Regarding the general questions, they are written in Go.     

I have written them such that the input values are configured inside of the program themselves and arent read in through command line execution.     

<br />

Please run these by cloning the repository, navigating to the folder, changing the values in the file and runnning by:      

go run [filename]     


<br />
E.g.:     

go run decimal.go
