Regarding the general questions, they are written in Go. \n
I have written them such that the input values are configured inside of the program themselves and arent read in through command line execution. \n
<br />

Please run these by cloning the repository, navigating to the folder, changing the values in the file and runnning by: \n
go run [filename] \n

<br />
E.g.: \n
go run decimal.go
